2 lab 2 explaination

 -lab 2 disccuss css layout using display , positionning , float, clear properties
 -in lab 3 more sophisticated proporties will be used for more responsive layout (flex, grid)
 - in this lab we try bloc, inline niline-bloc , none and hidden values  for display property
 - for the position propoerty we will discuss the difference between :static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky values
 - you have also to try the effect of float and clear properties

3- the almost work is done for index.html and styles.css document, you have to try modifinig the values  of different properties and observe the effect in each case.
    an observation is 
            1 a screen shoot
            2 the assoiated css style fragment
            3 a description made by you showing that your have  undestanded  the effect of the property. 

4 the final task : based on the aquired concepts in the above point you have to developp a web page (using only the display , position , float and clear properties ) styled header, sidebar, content, footer (you can also use proporties from lab 1 )
