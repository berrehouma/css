# Lab 2: CSS Layouts

## Objective
This lab is designed to help you understand and practice **CSS Layouts** using the following concepts:
1. **Display Properties** (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`).
2. **Positioning** (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`).
3. **Floats and Clears**.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create and manipulate layouts using these CSS techniques.

## Steps

### Part 1: Display Properties
1. Open `index.html` and observe the HTML structure.
2. In `styles.css`, review the CSS for `.block`, `.inline`, and `.inline-block`.
3. Notice how:
   - The `block` element takes up the full width and starts on a new line.
   - The `inline` element only takes up as much width as its content and stays in the same line.
   - The `inline-block` element behaves like an inline element but allows setting width and height.

### Part 2: Positioning
1. In `index.html`, observe the `.positioning-examples` section.
2. In `styles.css`, review the CSS for `.static`, `.relative`, `.absolute`, `.fixed`, and `.sticky`.
3. Notice how:
   - **Static**: The element stays in the normal document flow.
   - **Relative**: The element is offset from its normal position.
   - **Absolute**: The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
   - **Fixed**: The element stays in the same place even when scrolling.
   - **Sticky**: The element sticks to the top of the container when scrolling.

### Part 3: Floats and Clears
1. In `index.html`, observe the `.float-examples` section.
2. In `styles.css`, review the CSS for `.float-left`, `.float-right`, and `.clear`.
3. Notice how:
   - The `float-left` and `float-right` elements are floated to the left and right, respectively.
   - The `clear` element clears the floats and appears below them.

### Part 4: Final Task
1. In `index.html`, observe the final layout section (`.header`, `.sidebar`, `.content`, `.footer`).
2. In `styles.css`, review the CSS for the final layout.
3. Notice how:
   - The header is fixed at the top of the page.
   - The sidebar is floated to the left.
   - The main content is floated to the right.
   - The footer clears the floats and appears below the content.

## Deliverables
1. A folder containing:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `README.md`
2. Screenshots of the final layout displayed in the browser.

## Grading Criteria
- Correct use of display properties (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`).
- Proper application of positioning (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`).
- Effective use of floats and clears.
- Overall layout design and creativity.
